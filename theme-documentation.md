DJ Palace Residency - Modern Luxury Hotel Theme

# New Theme Implementation

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive luxury theme for the DJ Palace Residency website. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Theme Overview

The new theme creates a modern, sophisticated luxury hotel experience with:

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Warm luxury gold (#B8860B variants)
- **Background**: Pure white with subtle gold gradients
- **Text**: Rich charcoal for better readability
- **Accents**: Gold-based gradient effects

### Key Design Elements

#### 1. Enhanced CSS Variables (src/index.css)
- Complete redesign of CSS custom properties
- Sophisticated color gradients and shadows
- Luxury gold gradient effects
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design improvements

#### 2. New Utility Classes
- `.gradient-text-gold`: Animated gradient text effects
- `.card-luxury`: Premium card styling with hover effects
- `.btn-luxury`: Luxury button with shimmer effects
- `.input-luxury`: Elegant form input styling
- `.nav-luxury`: Premium navigation styling
- `.hover-glow-gold`: Gold glow effects on hover

#### 3. Advanced Styling Features

- **Smooth transitions** using cubic-bezier timing functions
- **Hover animations** with transform and shadow effects
- **Gradient animations** for dynamic text and backgrounds

#### 4. Enhanced User Experience

### Implementation Details

The theme maintains all existing functionality while adding:
- Better visual hierarchy
- Enhanced brand consistency
- Improved readability
- Modern aesthetic appeal
- Professional luxury feel

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Files Modified

1. **src/index.css** - Complete theme overhaul with new CSS variables and utility classes
2. **src/pages/Index.tsx** - Component structure prepared for theme classes (ready for enhancement)

## Next Steps

The theme is ready for use. To apply the luxury styling to components, replace existing classes with:
- Navigation: `nav-luxury`
- Buttons: `btn-luxury`

- Inputs: `input-luxury`
- Hover effects: `hover-glow-gold`

This implementation creates a professional, luxury hotel website that maintains the original functionality while providing a significantly enhanced visual experience.
